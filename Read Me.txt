1. To classify articles intro Brexit Immigration, we proceed in the following order:
   * For each newspaper, using keywords (see next two bullet points), we classify articles into the following categories:
      1. Brexit
      2. Climate
      3. Brexit, Climate
      4. Other
   * Brexit Keywords = ["brexit", "european union", " eu ", "british", "british identity", "british passport", "british culture", "british heritage", "british goods", "british products","british manufacturing",  "made in britain"]
   * Climate Keywords = ["climate change", "paris agreement", "environment", “global warming", "unfccc"]
   * Then for each article classified under Brexit, we divide the articles into the following categories using the keywords (see next bullet point(s)):
      1. Other
      2. Immigration
   * Immigration Keywords = ['migrant', 'refugee', 'immigrant', 'asylum', 'Calais']
      1. These keywords were selected based on the papers and discussion in UNHCR Report, Migration Observatory and Chase.
      2. The results could be found on the GitHub repository under headline_classifcation-11072020 and the output data for Express News is available at brexit_immigration.csv. 

   2. Headline Classifier function has been re-modified to now take multiple keywords and classes. The input has to be in the form of Python tuple class (e.g. (“Brexit, “Climate”). For more information, read the docstring.

   3. We compile data for all newspapers and retain only the date, newspaper name, headline using compile_newspapers.do and clean_news.do. This outputs clean_compiled_news.csv. 
      * Issue: For one entry, I had to manually fix it. It was not a headline, just a paragraph. This needs to be automated somehow. Similar issues arise when we run the do-files without dropping “text”. So, we can come back then.
      * Apply Step 1 on the output file for classification. Gives output file brexit_immigration_full.csv.
      * Using post_class_stats.do and brexit_immigration_full.csv, for each newspaper, we get the total number of articles published under different categories of Brexit (Brexit Other, Brexit Immigration for now) in a day.
